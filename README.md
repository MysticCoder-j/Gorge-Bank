Gorge Bank Command Line Account Management: 

Here is a simple command line banking progam which allows the user to check balance, deposit, withdraw, view last transaction, and calculate interest in specified

This project is in active development.  Stay tuned for future versions featuring more classes, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and JUnit testing.
